About:

We built this app as a lab in the GA WDI26 course Unit 2.

The intent was to build our first full-stack application.

We chose the Recipe/Ingredients Manager app that allows users to post their favorite recipes. 

The home page will show the titles of all of the recipes, and the title of the recipe will link to a page with the full recipe. 

Each recipe includes a title, a description, instructions, and ingredients. 

There will be a form for users to add recipes.

User Stories:

I can view a list of all recipes
I can click on a recipe title and go to the full recipe
I can add a recipe
